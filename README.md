We're porting [GTA: San Andreas](http://www.rockstargames.com/sanandreas/) to Unity!

This won't be a complete re-implementation of the game, but we're hoping to build something similar to [Multi Theft Auto](http://www.mtasa.com/) with assets streamed from an existing installation (it must be a legal copy) of San Andreas.

## How to request access

Please, to request acces to the [main repo](https://gitlab.com/uta-gi/uta-pns) send a mail to <a href="mailto:unitytheftauto@gmail.com">unitytheftauto@gmail.com</a> or write a message to @z3nth10n#0775 on Discord or a message to [@z3nth10n on Telegram](https://t.me/z3nth10n).

## Setup Instructions

- open the project
- open main scene located at Assets/Scenes/Main.unity
- press Play button

When running for the first time, the game will ask you for path to GTA installation, and will store that path in config.user.json. If you ever need to change the path, you can just edit this file.

## In-game controls

Press Escape while in game to open pause menu. You'll see there a lot of utilities, and among them, there is a window which shows all controls.

## TODO List

Here is an extensive list of [what should be implemented](https://gitlab.com/uta-gi/uta-pns/issues).

Can help us to develop this ? In that case, join us on discord so we can discuss about it.

## FAQ

### 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐢𝐬 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐲𝟑𝐃? 

Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies (in June 2005). The engine has been extended to support 27 platforms. The engine can be used to create both three-dimensional and two-dimensional games as well as simulations.

### 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐩𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐨𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬?

This won't be a complete re-implementation of the game, but we're hoping to build something similar to Multi Theft Auto with assets streamed from an existing legal copy of San Andreas.

Currently this project is able to read almost all contents from GTA San Andreas: models, texts, textures, configurations... Excepts sounds and read all of them into Unity3D.

### 𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐡 𝐢𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐬?

Currently there only 1 developer in the project. We are tying to catch new people that contribute to this project (advertising, donating or developing).

### 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐨𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐦𝐨𝐝𝐬?

This project provides an amazing advantage, thanks to the versatility of C# and the tools of Unity3D. Once this project is finished, making a mod for GTA:SA will not be a headache (due to the antiquated native programming method of the GTA San Andreas modification system).

With this project it is intended (after fully implementing the game itself) to convert the game with a new game engine, this will do that a greater number of modders and programmers and probably the community of GTA:SA (that is fine since 2004) be interested on GTA San Andreas title again, thanks to the previously mentioned improvements.

### 𝐖𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐛𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐚 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐆𝐓𝐀 𝐒𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬? 

Yes, it will also support multiplayer natively, in this way, there will be much more dynamism.

Test GTA San Andreas with an improved game engine, improved physics, improved textures and more realistic and fun features that we will implement.

### 𝐈𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐥𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐥?

Following what [Rockstar Games EULA](https://www.rockstargames.com/eula) specifies:

```
The Software is protected by U.S. copyright and trademark law and applicable laws and treaties throughout the world. The Software may not be copied, reproduced, altered, modified, or distributed in any manner or medium, in whole or in part, without prior written consent from Licensor.
```

We are not are modifying the game, because we are not modifying any file from the project, we are just reading it. Any modification done to the game is made inside Unity3D engine.

But we are reproducing its copyrighted contents. In this case, we can be C&D perfectly. 

Despite this, there are some points to consider:

- Rockstar Games main devs / lawyers has been permissive with all modifications done to the game (see SA-MP, MTA, CLEO Mods, TXD Workshop, SAAT, IMG Factory, Misterix Mod and a lot of tools / modifications that has been done to the project over time)

- Even Hot Coffee mod that was a vanilla feature before its release has been allowed (although this mentioned vanilla feature brought problems to Rockstar games in early 2005)

- The only thing that can bring problems to us are financial harms to Rockstar company, but we are not re-selling this project.

- There are major concerns to care about (in Rockstar point of view) because it's now 14 years since it release and there are more recurring revenue products (GTA V for example).

- We are happy supporting Rockstar in any aspect, we want to help them to make it's community great again (the San Andreas one) and, in the future, if we earn any financial profit we can share it with them.

We are not distributing any file:

- To play / edit this project you need an original and legal copy of the game (or not, but [we strongly recommend it](https://store.steampowered.com/app/12120/Grand_Theft_Auto_San_Andreas/)) buy from any place allowed to do that.

Any user that use this with a pirated copy is out of our responsability.
